    </p>

    <p>

      be done if it is technically feasible.
    </p>

      such as spam emails.
    </p>
    <h1>3. DATA COLLECTION ON OUR WEBSITE</h1>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>

    <p>
      Some of our websites use so-called cookies. Cookies do not cause any
      damage to your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies serve to make
      our offering more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are small
      text files that are stored on your computer and that your browser saves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies”. They are
      automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain stored on
      your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize
      your browser the next time you visit.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of
      cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance
      of cookies for certain cases or in general, and activate the automatic
      deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated,
      the functionality of this website may be restricted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cookies that are necessary to carry out the electronic communication
      process or to provide certain functions you require (e.g. shopping cart
      function) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The
      website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies in order to
      provide its services in a technically error-free and optimized manner. If
      other cookies (e.g. cookies to analyze your surfing behavior) are stored,
      we have listed them separately in this data protection declaration.
    </p>
    <h2>Server log files</h2>

    <p>
      The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in
      so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to
      us. These are:
    </p>

    Browser type and browser version operating system used Referrer URL Host
    name of the accessing computer Time of server request IP address

    <p>We do not merge this data with other data sources.</p>

    <p>
      The basis for data processing is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the
      processing of data to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual measures.
    </p>
    <h2>Contact form</h2>

    <p>
      If you send us inquiries using the contact form, we will save your details
      from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there,
      in order to process the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We
      will not pass on this data without your consent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data entered into the contact form is therefore processed exclusively
      on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke
      this consent at any time. All you need to do is send us an informal email.
      The legality of the data processing operations carried out up to the time
      of revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you
      request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for
      data storage no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been
      processed). Mandatory legal provisions – in particular retention periods –
      remain unaffected.
    </p>
    <h2>Registration on this website</h2>

    <p>
      You can register on our website to use additional functions on the site.
      We only use the data entered for the purpose of using the respective offer
      or service for which you have registered. The mandatory information
      requested during registration must be provided in full. Otherwise we will
      reject the registration.
    </p>

    <p>
      For important changes, such as the scope of the offer or technically
      necessary changes, we use the email address provided during registration
      to inform you in this way.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data entered during registration is processed based on your consent
      (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent at any time. All
      you need to do is send us an informal email. The legality of the data
      processing that has already taken place remains unaffected by the
      revocation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data collected during registration will be stored by us for as long as
      you are registered on our website and will then be deleted. Statutory
      retention periods remain unaffected.
    </p>
    <h2>Processing data (customer and contract data)</h2>

    <p>
      We collect, process and use personal data only to the extent that it is
      necessary for the establishment, content or change of the legal
      relationship (inventory data). This is done on the basis of Article 6
      Paragraph 1 Letter b GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill
      a contract or pre-contractual measures. We only collect, process and use
      personal data about the use of our website (usage data) to the extent
      necessary to enable the user to use the service or to bill for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The customer data collected will be deleted after the order has been
      completed or the business relationship has ended. Statutory retention
      periods remain unaffected.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Data transfer when concluding a contract for services and digital content
    </h2>

    <p>
      We only transmit personal data to third parties if this is necessary as
      part of contract processing, for example to the credit institution
      responsible for processing payments.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data will not be transmitted further or will only be transmitted if
      you have expressly agreed to the transmission. Your data will not be
      passed on to third parties without your express consent, for example for
      advertising purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The basis for data processing is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter b GDPR,
      which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or
      pre-contractual measures.

      Google Analytics cookies are stored on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f
      GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user
      behavior in order to optimize both its website and its advertising.
    </p>

    <strong>IP anonymization</strong>

    <p>
      We have activated the IP anonymization function on this website. This
      means that your IP address will be shortened by Google within member
      states of the European Union or in other contracting states to the
      Agreement on the European Economic Area before it is transmitted to the
      USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to
      a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator
      of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of
      the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other
      services related to website activity and internet usage to the website
      operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google
      Analytics is not combined with other Google data.
    </p>

    <strong>Browser plugin</strong>

    <p>
      You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software
      accordingly; However, we would like to point out that in this case you may

      interest-based advertising from Google and third-party visitor data. This
      data cannot be assigned to a specific person. You can deactivate this
      function at any time via the ad settings in your Google account or
      generally prohibit the collection of your data by Google Analytics as
      described in the section “Objection to data collection”.

      required web fonts into your browser cache in order to display texts and
      fonts correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this purpose, the browser you use must connect to Google's servers.

      attractive presentation of our online offerings. This represents a
      legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f
